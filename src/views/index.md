天格思你好，能否简单介绍一下自己，尤其关于你的民族和专业背景？  
_Hello Tengis, can you tell us a bit about yourself, your people and your professional career?_

你好，我是天格思，内蒙古八十年代的蒙古族，我父亲是个蒙古族诗人，母亲是音乐老师。我是个画油画儿的，现于内蒙古大学艺术学院攻读硕士，主要研究方向是北方少数民族美术，特别是早期游牧民族的视觉造型。没上过任何关于设计的课程，鼓弄字体纯属个人兴趣，  
Hello, I am Tengis Khasbagana from Inner Mongolia. My father is a Mongolian poet and my mother is a music teacher. I'm an oil painter and am currently pursuing my Master's degree at the Art College of Inner Mongolia University. The main subject of my research is the art of the Northern ethnic minorities, with a focus on the visual styles of the early nomadic tribes. I've never taken any formal design classes, all the type design work I've done stems from personal interest.

小时候家里亲戚有做报社排印工作的，会接触到活字铅板一类的东西，想必是被影响到了吧。更主要的原因是我自治区农业大学有了首个以恢复阿尔寨石窟文字为主要研究方向的蒙古文造型研究部门，常会与此课题的朋友们沟通，不过我个人更侧重可清晰阅读的文字设计，所以没有参与此项研究。但就是这种文字设计环境影响了我的造字热情。  
I was exposed to typesetting as a kid from relatives who worked in newspaper publishing and that was probably an influence on me. However, a more important reason is the Inner Mongolia Agricultural University established the first Mongolian language research department focused on scripts found in the A'erzhai Grottoes, and I'd have regular discussions with friends about this topic. But my primary interest is in the design of legible typography, hence I did not join in their research. But being in such an environment definitely bolstered my passion for designing typefaces.

能否谈一下蒙古文字体设计在今天国际上的发展情况？官方和其他机构对蒙古文字设计是什么态度？  
_Could you talk a bit about the state of Mongolian type design on an international level? What is the attitude of the government and other organisations toward Mongolian typography?_

中国规定了各民族都有使用和发展自己语言文字的自由，随之当然会有 GB 开头的国家标准以及名称很复杂的高级操作系统。官方统计内蒙古的蒙古族人口为417万，在全国近600万蒙古族人口中，有400万以上的蒙古族人口使用着本民族语言。同时颁布了官方本民族语言文字的专项法规。  
China has stipulated that all the ethnic groups have the freedom to use their native languages. <span class="doublecheck">So naturally, we have the Guobiao (GB) national standards and 名称很复杂的高级操作系统.</span> According to the national census, there are 4.17 million Mongols in Inner Mongolia. Among the 6 million Mongols in China, more than 4 million Mongols use the traditional Mongolian script, Mongol bichig. There are also official standards for Mongol bichig.

然而我在给学生上课时想用蒙语解释「写生」一概念时，完全找不到准确的词，只能用外蒙古的准确名词「өнгө эрэх」（寻找色彩感），但是他们都会傻眼说听不懂……  
However, there are times when I'm trying to explain certain concepts in sketching to my students, I can't find the appropriate terms in Mongol bichig. The closest is өнгө эрэх, written in Mongolian Cyrillic, which means to find a sense of colour. Even then, my students don't understand what I'm saying.

其实现实的语言环境正急剧萎缩，基本上与准确的学术名词以及日常细腻情感表达告别了，或者说目前就是这样一种特殊语境状况，所以无论文字被换成如何顺眼顺口的形式，比如有好多人说想用英文字母记录蒙古文，怎么念就怎么写，那样在社交网络里聊天写邮件很方便，说对普及蒙古文有好处。我不太同意，  
Actually, the Mongolian vocabulary is shrinking rapidly, words for proper terminology and many linguistic nuances no longer exist. Some people have suggested the romanisation of Mongolian using phonetic principles to improve ease of use, especially on-line, but I disagree with this approach.

不管换成什么样，蒙语专有名词已经没有了，或是一些很机械的翻译，所以到时候还是得用官方语言表达，如此只是换汤不换药。  
Regardless of how the method of writing is modified, the matter of fact is, many Mongolian nouns have either disappeared, or are crude translations from foreign languages, and we end up having to use official languages anyway. This is simply a superficial solution.

自治区要跟随国家的腔调去讲课，买东西，谈恋爱。 内蒙古作为自治区，更多机构致力于<span class="checkagainst">信息处理与国际编码的工作</span>，文字的造型研究该是下一步的计划。蒙古国有200多万人使用斯拉夫蒙文，从1995年起决定使用传统的蒙古文字。如今两种蒙古文字并行使用，但从具体实施的情况来看确实存在着一系列需要解决的问题。国际上一些蒙古学学者认为，蒙古文字的使用会趋向于统一化、标准化，但因种种政治原因，无论斯拉夫或传统蒙文都没能在文字上统一。但因学术需求，在美国、德国、匈牙利、俄罗斯、日本等地也不乏从事相关传统蒙古文研究的机构。他们主要的研究领域是蒙文字形、操作系统、多国语言字处理软件和印刷出版系统等。  
As Inner Mongolia is an Autonomous Region, we have even more organisations committed to <span class="doublecheck">information processing and the development of character encodings</span>. Research on Mongolian typeforms is also in the works. Mongolia has an estimated 2 million people using the Mongolian Cyrillic alphabet but in 1995, Mongol bichig was reintroduced to the school curriculum. Both writing systems are in use today, but there are still many issues to be resolved. Some researchers of Mongolian studies are of the opinion that Mongolian language is moving toward unification and standardisation, but because of various political reasons, neither the Cyrillic alphabet nor Mongol bichig have a standardised vocabulary. However, in the world of academia, there is no shortage of organisations engaged in the research of Mongolian language from countries like USA, Germany, Hungary, Russia and Japan etc. They mainly focus on Mongolian letter forms, operating systems, multilingual software development as well as print and publishing systems.

你从事的主要是蒙古文的文字和字体设计，能否简单介绍一下蒙古文的历史、使用特点？  
_You mainly focus on Mongolian script and type design, could you introduce the history of the Mongolian language and its characteristics?_

蒙古语族现在使用的文字体系产生于13世纪，其文字历史与其政治、文化、历史的发展是相辅相成的。人们一般将其分为三个阶段，1.产生时期：在政治历史上是蒙古国家权力形成阶段；文化史上与汉文化接触时期，包括女真、唐兀惕、突厥和吐蕃影响的汇流和蒙古人开始接触佛教的阶段；在语言上是中世纪蒙古语时期，即文学语言形成时期；2.复兴时期：政治上是16——17世纪蒙古族各部企图恢复统一的时期；文化上是佛教和西藏文化影响加强时期；在语言上是古典语言过度和标准方言形成时期；3.创立现代文字时期：蒙古语族与社会主义民族的合作下走向复兴和发展的阶段；在文化史上是与世界文化交流的阶段；现代文学语言形成。在上面提到的阶段中回鹘文占统治地位，其文字发展一直延续至今，是蒙古文字设计的主要对象，其他客串的文字历史就不多说了。  
The Mongolian writing system came about in the 13th century and is closely tied to the politics, culture and history of Mongolia. Its development can be split into 3 phases:

1.  The language originated from when the Mongol empire began its rise into power, during which there was cultural interaction with the Han, including the Jurchen, Tangut. Turkic and Tibetan people. Buddhism was introduced to Mongolia during this time. The Middle Mongol language was formed during this period.
2.  The Mongolian cultural renaissance during the 16th and 17th century saw a reformation of the Mongolian script. This period marked the rising influence of Tibetan Buddhism.
3.  The contemporary Mongolian Cyrillic was developed as a result of the close relationship with the Soviet Union. There was much global cultural exchange The Uyghur language was a major influence in the development of Mongol bichig, there were other minor influences but I will not cover those.

成吉思汗执政时期蒙古人就已借用了回鹘文字。9世纪回鹘及其他突厥民族使用的书面语文字源于闪米特（Semitic）语字母，经操中古伊朗语的粟特人传入中亚。蒙古语简化了原型、词首、词中、词末的字母形态，而且这些字母只表音位，不表音素。  
Mongolians had been using the Uyghur script since the time of Genghis Khan. The Uyghur alphabet used by 9th century Uyghurs and the Turkic peoples was in turn derived from the Syriac alphabet, which were introduced to Central Asia by the Sogdian people. Mongolian script is a simplification of the original letter forms, and they are phonemes but not phones.

一个值得注意的现象是远古的希腊——拉丁、闪米特语的 LM 顺序（英文字母中 L 和 M 的顺序，英文中是 J、K、L、M、N、O……蒙文中是 X、S、L、M、G、H……）在蒙古语中沿袭下来，只是书写方向有了变化，成为竖写。东部蒙古人至今在使用13世纪初引入的回鹘文字。现代蒙古文在外形和拼写方面和中世纪蒙古文已有区别，拼写方法上已有差别。17、18世纪虽进行了一些改革，但字母排列的基本规则没有变化。  
An interesting phenomenon to note is that the Mongolian alphabet follows the order of Ancient Latin and Semitic scripts, except that the script was rotated to a vertical writing direction. only changed the writing direction to vertical. People in East Mongolia still use the Uyghur script from the 13th century today. Mongol bichig differs from Middle Mongol in terms of spelling and letter forms due to reforms during the 17th and 18th century but the order of the alphabets remain unchanged.

亚兰（Aramaic）文字派生希伯来文字、巴列维文字（Pahlavi alphabet）、叙利亚文字、纳巴泰文字（Nabataean alphabet）、婆罗米文字等。其中叙利亚字母通过景教东传，中经粟特文的媒介，形成了形成了回鹘文，在回鹘文的基础上创制了蒙古文。 （以上资料参考了：[匈] Д·卡拉：《蒙古人的文字与书籍》范丽君译 乔吉审订 内蒙古人民出版社2004年 第1页，第9页，第12页；《维吾尔古文字古文献导论》牛汝极著 新疆人民出版社 1997年 第2页、第3页）  
The Aramaic alphabet is ancestral to a variety of alphabets including Hebrew, Pahlavi, Syrian, Nabataean, Brahmi and so on. The Uyghur language has its roots in the spread of Syriac-speaking Christians of the Nestorian Church to the east, which in turn formed the basis of the Mongolian language.

能否介绍一下你现在从事的几个主要的项目，包括内容和概念？  
_What are the major projects you're working on at the moment and could you tell us more about their content and concepts?_

以蒙文字母为基础，将托忒文、满文、锡伯文统一的编码方案，这一方案得到了国际标准化 Unicode 等组织的进一步重视。但是蒙文编码字符到底选用多少合适，存在着分歧，各类输入软件的键盘并不统一，  
One of them is the unification of the encoding scheme for the Oirat, Manju and Xibe scripts based on the Mongolian alphabet. This project has caught the attention of the Unicode consortium and other organisations. However, we have not worked out the complete set of Mongolian characters to be included and there are differences in input methods as well.

所以我的理想是最终将蒙古文字从键盘里标准的敲出来，并可以拿来<span class="checkagainst">关键词搜索，以及语音识别等一系列工作</span>。不过我一个人完全搞不来，在蒙古国立大学深造的一位字体博士塔拉与我一起，他会把相关信息处理的工作承担下来，我这边主要致力于文字造型，  
Ideally, I'd like to use the Mongolian input method, which can be used for <span class="doublecheck">keyword searching, speech recognition and so on</span>. But this is way too much work for me to take on alone. I've partnered with Dr. Talaa Bayar, Professor at the National University of Mongolia, who does all the information processing work while I focus on designing the individual glyphs.

现在手里有六套传统蒙古文字的前期造型，其中三套分 regular 和 bold（目前只能这样分）。<span class="checkagainst">主要内容是临摹，临摹是与扫描相对的，这也是因为画画儿的原因，要以主观的归纳来把握文献中的文字节奏</span>，另外蒙古文毕竟是表音的字母文字，字符数量有限，可以花一些时间来做细致的工作。我觉得在文字设计较弱的环境里从字体质量入手打下基础是最为首要的。  
I have working drafts of 6 Mongol bichig typefaces, of which 3 have regular and bold weights. <span class="doublecheck">The major task is digitising these typefaces, as each glyph is matched to scans of corresponding handwritten letters</span>. As Mongol bichig is a phoenetic alphabet, there aren't that many characters, which allows me to spend more time refining each glyph. Type design isn't as well established here, hence it is crucial to ensure the quality of each individual glyph to create a solid foundation for the typeface.

你似乎也在做一些平面设计的工作？是什么性质的项目？那些蒙古文字也是利用了一部分你现在设计的字体吗？  
_You seem to be doing some graphic design work as well, could you talk about that? Are the typefaces you're currently working on used in those pieces?_

对外盈利的项目我做的不多，同时做平面设计多是为了文字排印实验。相比以往的平面，我也希望能通过文字的更新有一些新面貌。我每年会有一段时间的绘画教学工作（校方也会硬安排给我一些设计的课程），会把新做的字体用在课件与效果图上，  
I don't usually do commissioned pieces. Most of what I do are personal typography experiments. Compared with the designs of yesteryear, I'm hoping to bring something fresh to the table through the use of typography. I teach a painting class every year (though the school will make me teach some design classes as well), and some of my typefaces will end up in the courseware and examples.

如《游牧时尚》服装效果图，算是一个标题文字的混排的实例，此系列图也是较自我的平面理解与绘画性平面绘图方法的一次尝试，如儿童图册《波穆巴的故事》算是个较为完整的新一批文字造型阅读排列实例（不过 kindle 里有像素显示问题，文字需改进）  
For instance, the series on Nomadic Fashion - Graphic Design for Cloth uses mixed typography, and was my personal experimentation on graphic design and illustration techniques. The children's book The Story of Bomba is a more concrete example of a mixed text layout publication, though there seem to be some rendering issues on the Kindle that I need to fix.

当然也常送一些字给写书的朋友，搞音乐的朋友做封面，也有一伙儿做文身刺青，T恤手机壳的小商贩向我要字，我也就直接给了，不知使用的情况如何，呵呵。  
I will also give the typefaces I create to friends who are authors or musicians for their cover designs. Sometimes I'll be approached by tattoo artists or designers of graphic tees and mobile phone covers for my typefaces and I'll just give them away. I'm not sure where those typefaces are being used now, to be honest.

设计上蒙古文有哪些难点和有趣的地方？  
_What are some of the challenges in designing for the Mongolian script?_

像西方文字对间距的考量一样，蒙古文的间距把握是一个困难，并且它是连着的，在一切完好的情况下可能会突然跳出来一个你没地方搁的词儿，为了照顾它一切工作可能要从头开始，所以多次排文试验是个无法避免的困难。  
Well, kerning is always a challenge. Mongolian alphabets are connected, so often you will encounter a combination that you did not cater for, and when that happens you may need to scrap everything and start over. Reworking the entire typeface is something that can't be avoided.

有趣的事情往往还是前人能干出来，他们的趣味可能会成为今日追求复古的标准。例如像1950，60年代蒙古文教科书上的活字排印，音节间需连贯的蒙古文活字，被印刷后留下缝隙已成为被时间酝酿成熟的趣味。我参考这种样式归纳了一套造型（mortal type），有缝隙的字在阅读时会有类似西方衬线体的松弛灰度，这是我们从前人作品的技术局限中看出的趣味，除了早期的文字归纳，20世纪初的文字遗留逐渐成为我们这一年龄段的人可以总结的大的「趣味」倾向。  
A lot of inspiration can come about from the past, maybe that's why vintage design is popular today. If you flip through textbooks printed in the 1950s and 60s, you'll find that there are tiny gaps between each syllable due to limitations in the printing process. Over time, it has become nostalgic to see text like that. I created a typeface (Mortal type), which is inspired by this printing limitation of the past. These remnants from the past are things that my generation find interesting from a design perspective.

类似汉字的黑体、楷体，蒙古文字有这种字体分别吗？  
_Han characters have different script families like Heiti or Kaiti. Does the Mongolian script have similar classifications?_

类似标题与正文的差别是有的。字体风格上也分黑体、白体（白体是适合做正文，笔画较轻的字体）或以某个书法家命名的手写正体。特殊的是与汉语相比即便是正体也带着许些斜体的味道，因其连贯性，标题文字也会保留手写韵律。  
There are differences in typefaces used for display text and those used for body text. Typefaces can be classified as Heiti, Baiti (which is suitable as text type due to its lighter stroke weight) or hand-written text type based on the calligraphy styles of known calligraphers. The main difference from Han-based scripts is that Mongolian text types generally have an italic feel to them. Even our display text typefaces retain certain calligraphic qualities.

但严格模仿西方的衬线或非衬线就不适合了，东方文字似乎不太能完全的冷峻，留下的那个有人情味儿的笔触也不能叫做衬线。所以字重的区别在多数文字中都存在，区别古典与现代形象的区别需进一步研究。  
We can't strictly apply western font classifications like serif or sans-serif. Eastern letters are much more humanist in nature, you can't call the flourish at the end of a stroke a serif either. Every character will have some degree of stroke modulation, differentiating between old Mongol script and contemporary Mongol script requires a more in-depth analysis though.

现在有成型的蒙古文字体吗？质量如何？使用广泛吗？能否出现一种现代意义上的，摆脱了手写风格的蒙古文字体？类似 Fedra Hindi 和 Helvetica Arabic。  
_Are there any established Mongolian script typefaces, if so, how well are they made? Are they widely used? Do you think there will be a Mongolian typeface that deviates from calligraphic styles, for example like Fedra Hindi or Helvetica Arabic?_

在此需要提一位日本设计师大曲都市（Toshi Omagari）。他的原话是：「There has not been any monolinear Mongolian font available in the world, but why not make it?」他的有一款叫做 Marco（马可·波罗）的字体我很喜欢，文字外形与衔接方式上很像 Helvetica Arabic，曲线讲究，比划韵律带着个人性格，阅读感也很强，他的设计代表了一种向现代靠拢的非本土的审美，即便这样其文字还是不能随意走出手写感的东方审美范围。  
I want to mention a quote by Japanese designer, Toshi Omagari. He said “There has not been any monolinear Mongolian font available in the world, but why not make it?” He created a typeface called Marco, which I am very fond of. Its letterforms and the way the letters are joined is similar to that of Helvetica Arabic, with refined curves and humanist strokes, it is very readable. His design reflects a contemporary take on Mongolian type design from a foreign perspective, but we can't just discard the calligraphic nature of the Eastern aesthetic either.

与西方文化，或者说是与现代环境对应的文化面貌决定了目前蒙古地区文字造型的审美取向。如果说早日与现代审美标准同步是一个正确的准则的话，个人认为目前还需一段时间来转化视觉习惯。反过来说如此慢半拍的文化运行模式，还没有反应过来自己没有被工业大潮席卷时，这可能是一个「将错就错的」正确，尤其在东方，只要能不去经营企业，就尽量制造与自我性格吻合的物品才是个有着自然品质的状态。我的一款字 Consummate Type Regular，Consummate Type Bold 最初想做成带着理性色彩的无衬线体，排字后完全不合口味，改成现在的摸样。  
Mongolian type design is moving toward the Western contemporary aesthetic, but I think it takes time for people to get used to this change in style. I was trying to go for a geometric sans-serif style when designing Consummate Type Regular and Consummate Type Bold but it did not look right at all, so I modified it to look like what it does now.

能否介绍一下你的新的非衬线体项目？  
_Could you tell us about your latest project for a sans-serif typeface?_

<span class="checkagainst">对绘画或音乐领域来说，能够用独立的语言，阐释自我生命的形而上状态是很难的事情。而在通过物品去认知生活本质的领域来说，物品本身的朴素面貌在很大程度上决定了人们的生活质量与文化内涵</span>，而附加的人文装饰可能会随着时间而常常变化。  
<span class="doublecheck">To have a language to express the metaphysical nature of life through art and music is a challenge. In the materialistic world we live in, our quality of life is determined by the superficial looks of the goods we consume</span>. Furthermore, people's tastes change with the wind.

西方人的字体从衬线到无衬线的过程有着清晰地新旧界限，是为脱离某种陈旧模式的再创造。而对蒙古文字的设计来说“无衬线”并非意味着单纯的文字造型革命，而意味着蒙古文字作为现代物品，使其更纯粹，改善其面貌的必要。所以蒙古文字造型向“无衬线“靠拢并非创造，更多是介于民族书写审美与现代习惯之间的造型调和。  
The evolution of western typefaces from serif to sans-serif crossed a very clear boundary between old and modern. The creation of sans-serifs broke away from traditional type design. For Mongolian type design, “sans-serif” is not necessarily a revolutionary change, rather it implies that a clean and crisp style is required to fit the contemporary aesthetic. So we can't consider it creating a sans-serif style but tweaking the traditional script to have a more contemporary look and feel.

现实习惯中我们已认可了几何美。<span class="checkagainst">而繁复的文字造型审美，慢韵律的阅读习惯，仍然在相似经济环境，普遍的人类智慧下同步存在着</span>。所以将非工业感的东方文字如何带着手工意味提炼成舒适的现代物品是此项目的主要内容。  
We have acknowledged the beauty in geometric styles. <span class="doublecheck">If we draw parallels to how the world is becoming more industrialised and the increase in human knowledge</span>, our typefaces will adopt a simpler and cleaner look and feel, suited to a glance-based reading environment. The key question is how do we blend the hand-written Eastern aesthetic with the Western mechanical look into a cohesive style which fits this contemporary aesthetic.

对于蒙古文和汉字、以及西文的混排你有什么经验之谈？  
_What are your thoughts and experiences on multi-lingual layouts?_

不同语言对同一事物无法给出完全相同的描述，因此不同民族语言文字是其特定的的思维载体置，不可以在一个平面互相替代。<span class="checkagainst">而不同的现代语言之间，因概念日渐浑浊而有了互通的地方，这种语言概念的无力感在现代混排中显现出来了</span>。  
It is not possible to express the exact same idea in a different language, we should not swap text of a different language into the same design and call it a day. <span class="doublecheck">Furthermore, the various languages of today seem to be bleeding into each other, this lack of distinction in expression is becoming evident when dealing with mixed typography layouts</span>.

<span class="checkagainst">不同地区古语文献对自我世界观的书面强调是现代设计所无法逾越的，这般以科学方法整合不同的感性类型于一版，显然不是一个技术能解决的困难</span>。  
<span class="doublecheck">The old languages from different regions express a unique view of the world that modern languages cannot hope to achieve. Technology is not going to solve the issue of achieving harmony among the differing sensibilities of each culture</span>.

<span class="checkagainst">但我们也没有更好的方法将不同的书写习惯放在一个真正合理的地方平行比较，只能以现代认识的极限将各类因素粗陋的挤进一个模式</span>。所以对混排的第一个直觉应该是向各自过去的方法靠拢。我也在一篇排版实验短文里提过此事，横竖排文字的版面冲突，个人认为在文字的变换上做文章不会有太大效果，媒介的变化会让版面舒服很多，  
<span class="doublecheck">Unfortunately there isn't a methodology that allows us to compare different writing systems on a level playing field. We can only use whatever limited knowledge of each typographic system we have and try to fit them into a workable layout</span>. With regards to mixed layouts, it seems intuitive to fall back to a layout native to each writing system. I mentioned this in one of my previous mixed layout experiments, regarding the conflict between horizontal and vertical layout. I feel that the text itself probably doesn't make a difference when it comes to readability, it's probably the medium that makes more of a difference.

如对甘珠尔经的排版样式参考实例，古代扁长媒介能够很好地解决蒙古文与英文的混排。 前人对书籍的热情，是现代文字外形的参考资本，但今天要针对更多电子媒介来考虑，目前我们还不能很好的解决横向纵向的输入问题，现代媒介的主流尺寸并不适合竖写文字， 这诸多因素还需一个一个解决。  
Taking the layout of the Kangyur scripture for example, we can see that the mediums of old, which tend to be lengthier, were good for combining Mongol bichig with English text. We can use those as reference for print and publishing, but when it comes to digital media, we don't have good solutions for the input of vertical script. Also, the dimensions of current digital media simply are not suited for vertical Mongolian text. These are all issues we need to address.

蒙古文文字设计的未来商业前景如何？ _What do you think is the future of commercial type design for Mongolian typefaces?_

东方文化开始兴起，对古老亚洲文字的平面以及阅读的使用开始变得乐观起来。最近蒙古文字在奢侈品以及大众时尚中被频繁使用，如此开端多是 logo 字体，很多个人就能完成，如某一天有规范的阅读需求时，一个造字团队可能会与商业一同成长起来。  
The popularity of Eastern culture seems to be on the rise, so this is a positive thing for traditional Asian typography in design and publishing. The use of Mongolian script on luxury goods and mainstream fashion has been increasing recently. Generally, typefaces used for logo designs can be created by individual designers. However, if there is a commercial demand for text types in publishing, it might be viable for a type foundry to be established.

蒙古文和中国民族文字的现代化和设计，有什么其他的民间努力吗？  
_Do you see any individual efforts with regards to the modernisation and design of Mongolian and Chinese typography?_

复兴民俗最近在平面视觉中变成了某种热烈的潮流，再次归纳的手工传承着实是保护知识的很好方式，当然留下学术材料与工具书同样重要，这是我们东方人的习惯，喜欢口传知识，这一点要像西方人学习。  
Folk art styles seem to be a design trend these days, and this is a good opportunity for us to pass on the knowledge of traditional hand-crafts, especially the technical manuals and other relevant documentation. The thing about Easterners is we favour the oral tradition, documentation is something we need to learn from the West.

蒙古族对早期法典、古典文献的考古式研究在官方已颇有成果，外蒙古已绘制了甘珠尔、玛卡礼赞、八思巴等经典文字的造型。现代表现方面涌现了一批年轻书法家，其作品也在世界各地成功展览，而更具有典型民间意味的团体或文字工艺却不很明显，文字造型方面民间作坊就很少，只能向前追到20世纪初有革命气息的印刷品，当然个人认为现在已是静心研究20世纪文字造型的成熟时期，从此题切入想必会是复兴民间印刷工艺的第一步。  
Archaeological findings of early Mongolian scripts and ancient texts like the Kangyur, 玛卡礼赞, and 'Phags-pa script have been successfully documented by the authorities in Mongolia. We have an emerging group of young calligraphers whose work is being exhibited all over the world, but they mainly do contemporary design styles. There does not seem to be many designers specialising in traditional design styles, even less so for type design. What we have are mostly the styles arising from the revolutionary period of the early 20th century. I suppose now that such typographic styles are relatively mature, it can serve as an entry point into the revival of traditional folk styles.

你认为蒙古文，包括中国民族文字设计现在存在什么问题和机会？  
_What are the challenges and opportunities faced in the design of Mongolian and also Chinese typefaces?_

语言环境的萎缩带来阅读方式的改变，从而不会形成民族的文字传统，当然这是一个政治问题，单纯从技术和学术上看，现在条件还是蛮好的，有足够安静的平台可以归纳有价值的文字形象了，只待某日能被大量使用就好。  
Reading habits are changing with the shrinking of the Mongolian vocabulary, and the lack of standardisation does not help. But this is a political issue. From a technical perspective, things seem to be going well. We have a stable platform on which to develop fonts, with the hope that their use will become widespread some day.
